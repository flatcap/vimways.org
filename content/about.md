## What?

Vimways is a Vim-themed advent calendar by [@robertmeta][1] and [@romainl][2]. Largely inspired by the early [24ways][3], our primary goal is to publish *one* high-quality articles about Vim per day during the *twenty four* days before Christmas.

That's twenty four articles written by knowledgeable users—both famous and non-famous among the community—distilled from the 1st of December to the 24th of December.

## When?

Every year, hopefully, from the 1st of December to the 24th of December. As of now, articles are published daily, at no particular time. This may change in the future as we get more organized.

The project itself started its life as a private IRC conversation between the two creators in July 2018, with [the first article][4] being published on the 1st of December 2018.

## Where?

* All the articles are published daily on [https://vimways.org/][5].
* The whole project has its home [on Github][6].
* The site itself has [an issue tracker][7] that we encourage you to use if you see anything wrong.

## Whom?

[@robertmeta][1] has been running the [#vim][8] channel for over a decade and a half, and in the last few years has also became a moderator of the [/r/vim reddit community][9].

[@romainl][2] has been learning—and helping others learn—Vim for eight years. He is currently paid for playing with a bunch of cool web technologies. What a lucky guy!

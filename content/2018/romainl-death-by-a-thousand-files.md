Moving around a buffer or project without aim, mainly in search of something "interesting", is not something easy to optimize as "interesting" is pretty much undefined until you find it. On the other hand, jumping to a specific point of interest is something Vim is very good at and that talent is an important part of its appeal. Unfortunately, normal mode commands take all the sunlight and the popularity of fuzzy finders and alternative file explorers tends to distract new and seasoned vimmers from Vim's most useful navigation features by systematically optimizing the wrong things and reinforcing bad habits.

In this article I will try to show how we can leverage some of Vim's not-so-advanced features to smooth out an essential part of our experience: navigation.

## Nobody move, nobody gets edited

Before examining *how* Vim can facilitate what I call "symbol-based navigation", let's put together a list of motivations for navigating away from the current view. What is the nature of the *next step*?

### The next step involves an *unknown* resource

This is certainly a valid motivation but not one we will be able to optimize much. We are basically left with a single technique: *exploring*, and a single category of boring but reasonably efficient tools: *file explorers*.

Vim happens to ship with a default hierarchical file explorer called [Netrw][doc-netrw] and also provides different levels of [command-line completion][doc-cmdline-completion] to Ex commands like [`:edit`][cmd-edit] or [`:vsplit`][cmd-vsplit] if you like it shell-like.

Those tools may seem rudimentary at first, maybe even clunky, but they can offer a great experience through a wealth of sub-features and sheer customizability. It is my opinion that one should learn how to use and extend that class of basic features before jumping on the plugins bandwagon.

### The next step involves a *known* resource that's not present in, or accessible from, the current view

Since we know at least *something* about that resource we can finally try some optimizations!

**If it's a file**, combining shortcuts (`../`, `%`, `#`), globs (`*`, `**`), and command-line completion ([`'wildmenu'`][opt-wildmenu] anyone?) with the aforementioned `:edit`--and similar commands--goes a long way:

ASCIINEMA

And if that's too limited, there's the amazingly versatile [`:find`][cmd-find] that does what `:edit` does but can also be trained to search for files in specific places, thus leveraging whatever naming conventions are enforced by our language/framework/project.

ASCIINEMA

Both `:edit` and `:find` depend on *many* options like [`'suffixesadd'`][opt-suffixesadd], [`'wildmode'`][opt-wildmode] or the super-powerful `'path'` that we will explore in depth later.

**If it's a symbol**, [tag search][post-tags] might be our best option as it's generic enough to not require much context *and* specific enough to not shower us with completely irrelevant results.

ASCIINEMA

### The next step involves a *known* resource that's present in, or accessible from, the current view

Of the three situations, this is the most common: we are looking at an unit of code, trying to figure out what gets in, what gets out, and if applicable, what it uses from the outside to work with what gets in. This situation is also the most interesting because it will allow us to explore powerful but sadly overlooked features.

From now on, our not-so-crazy assumption will be that everything that is used in this file is either named in this file or in another file directly accessible from this file.

#### Off The Beaten Path

We mentioned [`'path'`][opt-path] in relation with `:find` but that option is honored by (and instrumental in the good working of) many of the features we will see in this section.

The value of that option is a comma-separated list of directories--or globs that can be expanded to directories. If we take a look at the default value on UNIX-like systems:

```vim
:set path?
  .,/usr/include,,
```

we see that, when using a `'path'`-aware command, Vim is going to search for files in:

1. the directory of the current file, `.`,

2. `/usr/include` (Vim has a serious history with C),

3. the working directory, `,,`.

Locations #1 and #3 cover the basics but the real magic is implied by #2: we can add and remove whatever directory we want.

Suppose our project has a lot of internal directories that are of zero interest to us and a few "interesting" directories. We could change `'path'` to a helpful *and highly contextual* value:

```vim
set path=.,dirA,path/to/dirB,path/to/dirB/and/then/dirC
```

and do `:find *foo<Tab>` to find a file with `foo` in its name in the locations above. Even using the otherwise expansive `**` would not be *that* heavy-ended in this case because we are searching through a much smaller set of directories and files than before.

ASCIICAST

If we do C or C++, the default value could be *extended* (and not replaced) with paths to company-specific headers:

```vim
set path+=path/to/include
```

If we do JavaScript, we could set it up to only look into the directory of the current file and the `front/src/js/` directory:

```vim
set path=.,front/src/js/
```

Setting the *right* `'path'` is key to a smooth and useful navigation, symbol-based or not, but there are many other options that alter the behavior of some or all of the `'path'`-aware commands. We will try to cover them as they come into play.

#### Go to File

`gf` is another `'path'`-aware command that lets us jump to the file whose name is under the cursor. It is very useful, even with the default settings, but it will crap out on things that *we* know are filenames but are not really filenames, like:

```javascript
import foo from './path/to/fileNameWithoutExtension';
```

Luckily, we can set `'suffixesadd'` so that Vim mentally adds the right extension before looking up for the file:

```vim
" in after/ftplugin/javascript.vim
setlocal suffixesadd+=.js
```

`gf` as a lesser known sibling, `gF` that does everything `gf` does while also jumping to the given line number, if any:

```javascript
// TODO: investigate why path/to/file:12 was added
```

Here is how `gf` can be used to inspect included files:

ASCIINEMA

#### Include file search

The whole ["include file search"][doc-include-search] feature is a collection of commands designed around two options: [`'include'`][opt-include] and [`'define'`][opt-define].

**The first option**, `'include'`, is used to tell Vim how an "include", essentially a link to another resource, looks. That information is then used to follow *each* include found in the current file and every included file, in order to create a tree usable by the many commands related to include file search. The default value is once again a C classic but it can be changed to whatever works for your language/framework/library. Here is a simplistic but working value for EcmaScript 6:

```vim
" in after/ftplugin/javascript.vim
setlocal include=from
```

and here is a more serious value, still for ES6, with triple backslashes and all:

```vim
" in after/ftplugin/javascript.vim
setlocal include=^\\s*[^\/]\\+\\(from\\\|require(['\"]\\)
```

Sometimes, language designers get sloppy and you end up with too many legal syntaxes. Or they get fancy and you end up with a syntax too far removed from the actual directory structure and filenames. In such cases, plain `'include'` may still be used to spot an include but Vim will be incapable of mapping that weird syntax to an actual filename. This is where [`'includeexpr'`][opt-includeexpr] comes handy.

The value of `'includeexpr'` is a function that will be used by Vim every time `gf` and include file search commands find themselves incapable of finding the file. The example found in the documentation shows how the dot notation in:

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
```

can be transformed into the much more useful:

```text
org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext
```

which, when combined with the suffixes in `'suffixesadd'`, will hopefully point to a proper Java file.

When working with `'include'` and `'includeexpr'` we might want to check how our latest hack works against a real world case. This can be done with [`:checkpath!`][cmd-checkpath].

**The second option**, `'define'`, is used to tell Vim how a macro definition (C again, and the default value is also for C) looks. In language without macros, this option can be (ab)used to describe what a function signature looks like, or a class, or even a constant if that's your speed.

Here is a minimalist example that shows how to convince Vim that a JavaScript function should be considered as a macro:

```vim
" in after/ftplugin/javascript.vim
setlocal define=^\\s*function
```

Now, include file search support is definitely spotty across the built-in ftplugins so we may or may not have to set it all up, an action that may or may not be trivial. FWIW, my custom `'includeexpr'` function for JavaScript is 107 LOC long. Right now, it covers edge cases that presented themselves at work as well as Webpack/VSCode's aliases but it started small and messy, like everything big and beautiful.

Anyway, we are equipped so let's dive in!

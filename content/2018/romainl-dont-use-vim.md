Vim is an amazing text editor. I love it. Really, I wouldn't [organize][organize] a Vim advent calendar if I didn't. But, as amazing as it is, **Vim is not for everyone**. There, I said it.

Vim can't solve all your problems, or be a TUI version of your favorite IDE, or make you a better programmer, or land you that dream job in the Bay Area. But Vim *can* help you be more mindful, focused, and efficient, as long as you approach it with the right mindset.

## Vim isn't…

### an IDE

### particularly suited for $LANGUAGE

### as ubiquitous as you might think

### a tool you can learn in an afternoon

### a toy

## What Vim is

### a text editor

## How to approach Vim

## Parting words

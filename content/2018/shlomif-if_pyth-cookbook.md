# if_pyth (= the python interface) cookbook

Content to cover:

- Why if_pyth
    - python (or perl or whatever) are often better than vimscript
    - pypi / pip
    - write extensions in C/etc.
- Processing/filtering each line in a range of lines
- Processing an entire subrange / selection of lines at once
- Accessing vimscript variables and registers
- Writing vimscript functions in python.

Ideas/comments/feedback appreciated :)

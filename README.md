# vimways.org

This is the main repository for [vimways.org](https://vimways.org), a project
by [@romainl](https://github.com/romainl) and
[@robertmeta](https://github.com/robertmeta).

[Vimways.org](https://vimways.org) is largely inspired by
[24ways.org](https://24ways.org/) but, instead of covering such broad subjects
as web design and web development, our focus will *exclusively* be on
delivering high quality articles about [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and its
thriving ecosystem.

See you on the first of December!
